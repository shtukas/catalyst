NXFlightData:
    - startTime       : Float # unixtime
    - startPosition   : Float
    - targetTime      : Float # unixtime
    - targetPosition  : Float

The positions are given as listing metric

We have a linear progression during 90% of the time to target and then we land exponentially on the target
